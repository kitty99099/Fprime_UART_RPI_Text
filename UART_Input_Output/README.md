# UART_Input_Output Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the UART_Input_Output Application

In order to build the UART_Input_Output application, or any other FÂ´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd UART_Input_Output
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the UART_Input_Output application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd UART_Input_Output
fprime-gds
```

To run the ground system without starting the UART_Input_Output app:
```
cd UART_Input_Output
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd UART_Input_Output/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./UART_Input_Output -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```
